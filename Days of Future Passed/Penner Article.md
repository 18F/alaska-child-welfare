WIRED MAGAZINE, July 2025: Neo-ORCA: The planet depends on it.

Last week the Neo-ORCA team was awarded with the Nobel Prize for Child Welfare System Innovation as well as the Nobel Prize for Technology that Saved the World.

The team’s task started out simple enough: create a Child Welfare Information System that users love, but is also efficient, economical, and effective. The technology had to be flexible enough to accommodate emergent needs and adapt to the future.  

The Neo-ORCA team set a goal of five years to implement all phases of Neo-ORCA’s core modules. The Administration for Children and Families officially declared Neo-ORCA’s staff as the ‘CCWIS Dream Team’ when they managed to reach their goal in three years. User Satisfaction surveys reached 100% for 100% of users within 6 months of implementation of Phase II. Within a year of implementation of Phase III, 25 states were using a clone of Neo-ORCA’s core functionality. Within 2 years all remaining states were using Neo-ORCA and the (patented) Global Warming Reduction By User technology was discovered: An unintended feature of the application reduces, by user, global warming by eliminating greenhouse gas emissions. Naturally word of this technology spread like wildfire throughout the world as companies scrambled to adapt this technology to their particular business model.

The Neo-ORCA team humbly accepted their Nobel Prizes from an undisclosed remote location, along with regrets they could not attend ceremonies due to obligations required for their current mission.
