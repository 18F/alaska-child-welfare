Children’s Services Improving Software and Families
July 1, 2020
JUNEAU, ALASKA — Good software can change children’s lives.
 
That’s one of the lessons learned by Alaska’s Office of Children’s Services (OCS) over the past two years, after they began to overhaul the software they use to track children in the welfare system.
 
ORCA (“Online Resources for Children in Alaska”) had gotten long in the tooth after a decade of use, and the state department found that the case-management website no longer suited a modern technology environment. “ORCA was built around a desktop-computer model,” said OCS spokesperson Jon Doe, “and that just isn’t the world that we live in now.” Case workers, who spend much of their time making home visits, couldn’t use ORCA from cars or airplanes. “That might work in some places, but here in Alaska, our case workers spend a huge amount of their time traveling.”
 
By retooling ORCA to function on state employees’ iPhones, OCS made it possible for case workers to check on case statuses while on the go, and even update records from their phone. Giving case workers access to timely information, and the ability to rapidly update that information for others, keeps children from falling through the cracks.
 
This is just the first of many improvements that are planned.
 
“Instead of having one big system, now [ORCA] is made up of a dozen different parts,” explained Jane Roe, the system architect. “This modular approach makes it much easier for us to replace old functionality or add new functionality, with each bid out as a small, stand-alone contract. Last year we added a Management Incident Tracking Tool — which used to be a totally separate thing — ensuring that no case worker has their health or safety unnecessarily threatened.” If a case worker is going to a home where there has been an incident, they are alerted in advance, and presented with a narrative about what happened there previously.
 
“This can be a hard job, but feeling like I wasn’t safe was a bridge too far,” said Jane Poe, a case worker. “Knowing what I’m getting into has made a huge difference.”
 
There have been corresponding improvements in performance metrics. For example, reports of assaults against case workers have been reduced by nearly 40% in the past year, over the prior twelve months, which resulted in part from the new incident tracking tool. And when the agency received reports of a child in impending danger in 2019, a case worker was on site 12% faster than in 2017. A recent agency report attributed that improvement to mobile push notifications that reroute the nearest case worker. And a February audit found that the error rate in case records had dropped by 28% since 2016, which case workers attributed to being able to take notes on their phone minutes after concluding a site visit, instead of when they return to their office, hours or days later.
 
It will be another year until it will be possible to see whether these improvements affect the state’s performance on statewide date indicators, but there is good cause to believe that they’ll reduce the overall recurrence of maltreatment.
