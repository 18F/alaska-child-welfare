## Child Welfare Innovations Showcased at Annual Technology Event
### Washington DC -Â January 18, 2020

At the annual technology awards today, the State of Alaska's Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) showcased it's Neo-ORCA system for child welfare, developed over the past several years using a procurement strategy called "modular contracting." DHSS officials were on hand to receive an innovation award at the event, and also discussed their work on the groundbreaking system with attendees.

After an initial engagement in 2017/18 with a federal entity called the Technology Transformation Services (TTS), part of the General Services Administration's Federal Acquisition Service, DHSS adopted new practices to incrementally enhance their old child welfare system to leverage new technologies, and to adapt to changing federal requirements for child welfare systems. In their presentation, DHSS officials discussed their adoption of agile software development practices to compliment their new modular procurement strategy.

Instead of using the traditional government contracting approach of developing a large, complex procurement, DHSS used a product-based approach to identify key modules to be developed over time, and structured solicitations to have these modules developed by vendors that worked using agile practices. Some attendees were initially skeptical of the approach, and raised a host of issues that could undermine such a modular approach, which - while being more widely adopted by governments - is still relatively new.

DHSS officials addressed these questions by explaining how their use of agile practices complemented their modular procurement strategy, and led to the adoption of a new practice called DevOps (which was also discussed in another session at the conference). The initial consultation by TTS helped DHSS adopt these new practices that they put into practice for the next few years, leading to their groundbreaking new system and their place on the stage at the innovation conference.

After the awards presentation, many other state officials from across the country sought out DHSS officials to learn from their approach.
