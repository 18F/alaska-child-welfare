# HHS Recognizes Alaska's Child Welfare System as a Model for Working with Software Vendors

Juneau, Alaska

With any large organization it's rare to find people that enjoy working with the software they've been given to do their jobs.  This is especially the case if the software was built on top of a system that is over a decade old. But when Alaska's ORCA project manager was told by the federal agency in charge they had to upgrade their system to meet higher federal standards, she decided to take a brand new approach - talking to the users.  

When the Department of Health and Human Services first laid out the new requirements for any state that wanted matching funds (they changed from SACWIS to CCWIS but that's not important right now) - there was a groan on the Alaska team.  Their system had been built in a way that couldn't easily adapt to new policies.  There were workarounds like any federal or state software system, but the idea of introducing new features was unimaginable.

ORCA's project manager had seen how this goes in the past and dreaded the idea of sitting in a year of "requirements gathering" meetings then a year of procurement, then a year of crossing her fingers while the vendor designed to what they thought they needed years ago.  She was used to every new feature requiring some change request (more money to the vendor), and typically taking months to implement.  She was not interested in doing that again.  

She decided she and her team were going to take back ownership of the solution.  She wanted her field workers to enjoy the software they were building for them, not dread having to work around it to get their jobs done.  She wanted it to bring value to the users.

With that, Neo-ORCA (new Online Resources for Children of Alaska) was launched.  

>"We were adamant that we were going to work in a new way, with vendors that could work in a new way.  We started small, got used to working with our users coming first, and gradually unwound from the legacy system to one that could adapt to changing policies and user needs.  We called it NEO-ORCA because NEO sounds cool.

Some of the challenges along the way included

  * Federal Agencies requiring years of master plans and detailed budget estimates that took the team's attention away from delivering working software.
  * State IT Security folks assuming that documentation was the way to address security.
  * Incumbent vendors and proprietary software salespeople attacking their efforts and sowing doubt amongst the various stakeholders about what Neo-ORCA was up to.

The only way that the state could resist power through these obstacles and introduce software that is joyful for its workers was to take ownership of their product, their strategy, and their decision-making.  This came by setting up a flexible roadmap, opening up the code, and finding vendors that were willing to help them find "the new way" by "just getting started".

CMS now recognizes that this "new way" is all about "demos, not memos" and has seen the difference Alaska has made on behalf of it's most vulnerable population.  

(*Editor's note - earlier publications failed to mention that this was a hell of a lot cheaper because they weren't beholden to a single supplier/platform.*)
